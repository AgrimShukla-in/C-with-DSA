## Today's Class: Installation & Hello World

**Date:** 2025-05-11

Today, I installed a C++ compiler on my Windows 11 machine (using either MinGW-W64 or Visual Studio) and wrote my first C++ program. Below is the code for `hello.cpp`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
